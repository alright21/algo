# algo

A list of **al**(right)gorithms written in **go**, written for fun, learning the language and reviewing previously studied concept. I will add more algorithms in the future.

It is written as a go module, so it is possible to download it and use in your programs (using `go get`)


## Algorithms

1. Merge Sort: time complexity `O(n log n)`
